### Using synthetic data. Chosen models are XGBoost and Random frest classifier models

##### This project aims to develop an advanced credit card fraud detection system leveraging cutting-edge feature engineering techniques. Our dataset comprises credit card transactions of U.S. users spanning a period of 20 years. Innovative feature engineering techniques will be employed to create predictive features that capture nuanced patterns of fraud. By combining traditional features with novel ones, the  aim is to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the detection model.
