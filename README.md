### Using synthetic data. Chosen models are XGBoost and Random frest classifier models

##### This project aims to develop an advanced credit card fraud detection system leveraging cutting-edge feature engineering techniques. Our dataset comprises credit card transactions of U.S. users spanning a period of 20 years. Innovative feature engineering techniques will be employed to create predictive features that capture nuanced patterns of fraud. By combining traditional features with novel ones, the  aim is to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the detection model.
##### The data comprises over a million rows. Each row corresponds to unique transactions conducted by users, encompassing comprehensive information such as sender details, receiver details, transaction amount in dollars, and, most critically, whether the transaction has been flagged as fraudulent or legitimate. It is important to note that this dataset exhibits a significant class imbalance, with a relatively low proportion of fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones. This inherent imbalance will be meticulously addressed and carefully managed during the model development and training process to ensure the highest levels of predictive accuracy and fraud detection efficiency.
